Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field of computer science focused on 
creating intelligent machines capable of mimicking human cognitive functions such as learning, 
problem-solving, and decision-making. In recent years, AI has significantly impacted various 
industries, including healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment. AI-powered applications, 
such as chatbots, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems, have transformed the way we 
interact with technology. Machine learning and deep learning, subsets of AI, enable systems to 
learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming. However, AI also poses ethical 
challenges, such as bias in decision-making and concerns over job displacement. As AI technology 
continues to advance, it is crucial to balance innovation with ethical considerations to ensure its 
responsible development and deployment.
